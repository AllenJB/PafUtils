Royal Mail PAF address assembler

Given address data from the Royal Mail PAF file (CSV format), assemble the address lines.

This is done primarily using the rules laid out in the Programmers Guide, with some additional tweaks for
situations encountered that are not covered by those rules.

A full set of unit tests is provided to prove behaviour in given situations.

If you find any situations not covered by the existing tests, please file a bug or submit a pull request.
